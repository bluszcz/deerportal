### Classical elements

* Water (blue) 
* Earth (green)
* Fire (red)
* Air (yellow)


### Players

There are four players, each one being leaded / mentored by one of the classical element. They are able to:

* move around their board
* collect runes and diamonds
* meditate to get help of their patron 
* reach the Deer Portal 


Each player can be controlled by a human or a computer (it is possible to watch a duel of four computers, for example).

### Diamonds

To be allowed to pass the transformation you need to gift the Almighty Deer. The Almighty Deer likes shiny things, so collecting diamonds is a way to please him. A player who owns most diamonds on the Judgement Day - is a winner. The rest is being thrown into the flames of the infinitive, filled with collapsed realities folded in time void. Diamonds are being collected by moving the character onto the field containing a diamond, but also by grabbing a runes containing diamond action.

### Cards

On the right of the board game, there are four piles of 32 the cards dedicated to each of the classical element. To collect a card, player must put his character on a field containing a corresponding to the element rune. Rules are following:

* When the player collects his own element - card is being removed from the pile and next one unveiled. 
* When the player collects the other element rune - a card is being executed in the field of the element which card has been taken.


#### Types of the cards

* Stop - increases the **pause period** of the  other element character. 
* Collect a diamond - steals diamond from the other element field. 
* Collect two diamonds - steals two diamonds from the other element field. 
* Collect rune - eliminates rune from the other element field. 


### Meditation

To meditate player has to go back to his start point, and since it depends on the mood of the patron, this is only possible by throwing exact numbers on the dice. It results in regenerating all the runes and diamonds on his board.

### Deer Portal

In the middle of all the boards, there is Deer Portal, with the **Hooftlar** (the Almighty Deer Good altar) placed in the center. First player who reaches it and pay tribute to Almighty Deer, starts **Deer Mode** period which takes exactly four rounds (four turns for each player). After that everyone who didn't reach the portal - will be ceased. 


##Game mechanic


Each player who is active (didn't reach Hoofltar yet, nor is being paused) has to perform two actions during his turn - throw a dice (by the click on dice symbol in the right bottom area of the screen), and then decide where to go - by clicking on the corresponding area on his board. After moving the player, depends on the destination field:

* Collects the diamond - if there was one
* Collects the rune and executes the card - if a rune was on the field
* Meditates - if the field was a starter place for the character
* Moves to the Deer God kingdom - by entering the portal. 

If a player entered portal as the first one - he does start Deer Mode and gets awarded with the few diamonds.



## End of the game

There can be only one winner, a player having highest number of the collected diamonds. If there is a draw, award goes for the player who reached portal first. Winner is being transformed into a Deer God. Rest of survivors are becoming his monks, the believers to spread the word. Ones who didn't survive, became a first heritage and a foundation of the new philosophy.
